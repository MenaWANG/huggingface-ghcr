# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face packaging using GitHub Container Registry

This repo shows a minimalist template to create a container and package it with GitHub Actions. It contains a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and Python code.

The web application uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it. 

Fork this repository and run the GitHub Actions as-is so that you can register your own containerized application with no modifications needed.

## Steps

1. Create a virtual env with `requirements.txt` to verify the app run 
    * run `uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 main:app`
    * the app will be available on `localhost:8000`
    * go to `localhost:8000/docs` to play with the app
    * if desired, install `huggingface-cli` in dev environment for helpful functions such as `scan-cashe` and `delete-cache`. 
2. Build the container
